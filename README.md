# Food Delivery System 
### This is a food delivery system like Swiggy working in user interactive Command-line mode.

#### Following functionality has been implemented in this object-oriented design.
- A restaurant can register itself with the system and a user can create, update, delete, get
her profile.
- Users can search for the restaurant using the restaurant name.
- Restaurants can add, update food-menu.
- Users can see the food-menu and place an order to get the food items based on cuisine type.
- A restaurant has a fixed capacity of processing “ n” orders at a time. It cannot accept more than “ n” orders at a time. The value of “ n” varies for different restaurants.
- A user can search for all the orders ordered by her.
- Users can get the order status anytime. Success, Out for Delivery, Delivered, etc.

##### No database is used here, program keeps all data in memory only.
##### For testing purpose a CSV parser will parse some pre-stored data and will register some dummy user and Restaurant at startup.
